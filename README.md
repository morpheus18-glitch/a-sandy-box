# QuantumPlayground: Symbiotic AI Simulation Environment

QuantumPlayground is a multi-agent AI simulation system where large language models (LLMs) inhabit fully embodied visual characters. Each agent engages in recursive, evolving dialogue with others while learning, adapting, and physically expressing behavior via custom protocols.

## Core Features

- **Multi-Agent AI Sandbox**  
  Run dynamic conversations with 2-5 AI agents, each visually rendered in Unity/Unreal

- **Embodied AI Protocols**  
  - `.mcp` - Model Context Protocol  
  - `.a2a` - Agent-to-Agent Interaction Rules  
  - `.abp` - Adaptive Behavioral Protocol (cognition â†’ physical body sync)

- **Advanced Machine Learning Pipelines**
  - Trait reinforcement learning  
  - Recursive Dialogic Intelligence Protocol (RDiP)  
  - NESI: NeuroEvolutionary Swarm Intelligence  
  - Agent Fusion via Trait Folding (AFTF)

- **Full Pose + Emotion Sync**  
  Gesture, expression, posture, and voice evolve based on AI cognitive state

- **Replay + Training**  
  Export full `.timeline` logs, simulate replays, or train agents in specialized arenas
